## Simple Summary

An extension to the [ERC-20](/EIPS/eip-20) standard token that allows Token owners to donate to some charity organization.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of the standard token to enforce charity donation by default. This standard is an extension of the [ERC-20](/EIPS/eip-20) token to provide transfers to a third-party charity during transactions. This standard also allows token that support [ERC-20](/EIPS/eip-20) interface, to have a standardized way of signalling charity information, registered by the token contract.

## Motivation

The initial idea is to allow Token owners to easily donate passively, in order to facilitate contributions to non-profit organizations and facilitate integration by giving a generalized implementation. Users can make an impact with their token and can contribute to achieving sustainable blockchain development. It is the possibility to donate simply with micro-donation during transactions. Projects can easily retrieve charity donations addresses and rate for a given [ERC-20](/EIPS/eip-20) token, token holders can compare minimum rate donation offers allowed by token contract owners.

## Specification

**ERC-20 compliant contract MAY implement this ERC for automatizing Mirco payment during transactions.**

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Owner of the contract **MAY**, after review, register charity address in `whitelistedRate` and set globally a default rate of donation. To register the address, the rate **MUST** not be null.

Token holders **MAY** choose and specify a default charity address from `_defaultAddress`, this address **SHOULD** be different from the null address for the donation to be activated.

Token holders **MAY** choose a donation rate different from the default one, individually for a specific charity address, by modifying the rate in `_donation`.

Donations are calculated as a percentage of the amount of token transfered, this percentage is added to the initial amount of token transferred. `_feeDenominator()` is overridable but defaults to 10000, meaning the rate is specified in basis points by default but **MAY** be customizable just as the `_defaultRate()` that default to 10.

To create and deploy an ERC20Charity contract one MAY only inherit directly from this [ERC-20](/EIPS/eip-20) extension that would directly signal support for ERC20Charity :

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
import "./ERC20Charity.sol";

contract CharityToken is ERC20Charity {
    // ...
    constructor() ERC20("TestToken", "TST") { }
    // ...
}
```

checking if a contract implement this specification can be done with :

```solidity
//import "./IERC165.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC165.sol";

bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERCcharity = type(IERC20charity).interfaceId; // 0x557512b6

function checkInterface(address _contract) external returns (bool) {
    (bool success) = IERC165(_contract).supportsInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERCcharity);
    return success;
}
```

```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) public whitelistedRate; 
    mapping(address =>  mapping(address => uint256)) private _donation; 
    mapping (address =>address) private _defaultAddress; 

    address[] whitelistedAddresses; //Addresses whitelisted

    event AddedToWhitelist (address toAdd);
    event RemovedFromWhitelist (address toRemove);
    event DonnationAddressChanged (address whitelistedAddr);
    event DonnationAddressAndRateChanged (address whitelistedAddr,uint256 rate);
    event ModifiedCharityRate(address whitelistedAddr,uint256 rate)

```

## Rationale

This standard provides functionality that allows token holders to donate easily. The donation when activated is done directly in the overridden `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions.

The donation is a percentage-based rate model, but the calculation can be done differently. Also, donations could be in other functions than the `transfer` function.

 To manage the whitelist the owner of the contract can choose to whitelist charity addresses by using an array and keeping track of the "active" status with a mapping. The donation address can also be a single address chosen by the owner of the contract and modified by period.

 They can also choose to store the donation in the contract or in another and add a withdrawal or claimable function so the charity can claim the allocated amount of token themselves, so the transfer function will be triggered by the charity and not the token holder.

## Backwards Compatibility

There are no backward compatibility issues, this implementation is an extension of the functionality of [ERC-20](/EIPS/eip-20). This EIP is fully backward compatible and introduces new functionality retaining the core interfaces and functionality of the [ERC-20](/EIPS/eip-20) standard.

## Test Cases

*Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes.  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.*

## Reference Implementation

*An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.*
The reference implementation of the standard can be found [here]().

## Security Considerations

There are no security considerations related directly to the implementation of this standard. It is to the discretion of the owner of the contract to review charity addresses before whitelisting them and to the token holders to determine whether setting this address as the `_defaultAddress` that will receive donations or not.
